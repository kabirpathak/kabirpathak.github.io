    <p>Hi, I'm Kabir Pathak, a Senior Full Stack Developer at eLitmus, where I primarily work with Ruby on Rails and React.
    I'm passionate about building efficient, scalable web applications and enjoy the collaborative, problem-solving
    nature of software development. I'm also an active contributor to the open-source community, particularly within the
    Ruby on Rails ecosystem. Contributing to <a href="https://github.com/users/kabirpathak/projects/1" target="_blank">open-source</a> allows me to both give back and continue learning from other
    developers across the globe.</p>
    <br />
    <p>In my free time, I take part in competitive coding to keep sharpening my problem-solving skills and often dive into
    reading open-source code to understand different approaches and techniques. I believe in continuous learning and
    enjoy expanding my knowledge through these activities.
    </p><br />
    <p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me on a badminton court, playing a game of chess, or sharpening my fooball
    skills. I also have a deep love for musicâ€”I've been playing the violin for about 15 years and was honored to receive
    a scholarship from the Indian government (HRD ministry) for my talent. It's been a rewarding journey balancing both
    my technical and musical interests.
